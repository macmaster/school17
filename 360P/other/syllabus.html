<b>Prerequisites</b>: Grade of C- in EE 422C</p>
<p><b>Course Contents</b>: 
This is a senior-level undergraduate course in concurrent and distributed
computing. It will expose students to theoretical as well as practical aspects
of designing and implementing concurrent and distributed systems. 
The course assumes that the student knows programming and basic data structures. 
There will be two mid-terms and one final exam.
The following topics will be covered in the course:

</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Constructs in concurrent languages: </i>threads, semaphores, monitors, wait and signals, inter-process communication. </li>
  <li><i>Networking in Java:</i> Sockets, Streams, Java RMI </li>
  <li><i>Fundamentals of Concurrent Computing:</i> Mutual Exclusion, Locking, Deadlocks </li>
  <li><i>Fundamentals of Distributed Computing:</i> Logical clocks, Mutual Exclusion, Snapshots, 
leader election, global property detection, Distributed Consensus, Paxos, Security </li>
  <li><i> MPI</i> High performance computing using MPI collectives, communication and computation</li>
  <li><i>Cloud Computing:</i> Google File System, Map Reduce, Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL Databases</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Grading</b>: 30 % Assignments, 15 % Exam 1, 15% Exam 2, 15% Project, 25% Final Exam. <br>

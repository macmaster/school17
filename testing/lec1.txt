Proposition -- statement that's true or false

proposition for any nonnegative integer n
  n**2 + n + 41 is prime.
  p(40) = 40**2 + 40 + 41    false statement, but a proposition nontheless.

proposition Euler's conjecture 1769
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 no solution when a, b, c, d > 0.
(a,b,c,d) = (95800,217519,414560,422481)

proposition Fermat's last theorem 1630
there are no positive integers 
x,y,z such that x^n + y^n = x^n where n > 2.
true

proposition Goldbach's conejecture. 1742
every even integer > 2 is the sum of 2 primes
holds true for all nunmbers up to 10^18. we don't know yet.

Predicate -- proposition whose truth value depends on some variable(s)
p(n) = "n is a perfect square."
under what circumstances is that statement true?

Logical Deduction
Rule
 p, p->q, then q. // implication  (!p || q)

example proof:
Given any x : x <=2 && x >= 0
x, 2-x, 2+x are >= 0
therefore, their product is also >= 0.
Adding 1 to the number gives a + number
x(2-x)(2+x) + 1 > 0.
x(4-x^2) + 1 > 0.
-x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0.

Prove the contrapositive:
  p -> q logically equivalent to ~q -> ~p  (~(p && ~q))

If r is irrational, then sqrt(r) is also irrational
proof:
We prove the contrapositive,
Suppose sqrt(r) is rational.
Then, there exist integers m, n such that sqrt(r) = m/n.
then, r = sqrt(r) * sqrt(r) = (m^2 / n^2).
m^2 and n^2 are also integers, so r is rational.

prove p<->q<-> by showing p = q = r
show p<->q  and q<->r
can also show p->q q->r r->p

proposition p, q
!p
p&&q
p||q
p->q
p<->q
pXORq

* SAT Problem -- Important for testins
  given some formula
  (p||q&&r)
     find values for p, q, r such that the formula is true.
  solution:
  	(p,q,r) = (t,f,f)

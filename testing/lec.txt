Proposition -- statement that's true or false

proposition for any nonnegative integer n
  n**2 + n + 41 is prime.
  p(40) = 40**2 + 40 + 41    false statement, but a proposition nontheless.

proposition Euler's conjecture 1769
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 no solution when a, b, c, d > 0.
(a,b,c,d) = (95800,217519,414560,422481)

proposition Fermat's last theorem 1630
there are no positive integers 
x,y,z such that x^n + y^n = x^n where n > 2.
true

proposition Goldbach's conejecture. 1742
every even integer > 2 is the sum of 2 primes
holds true for all nunmbers up to 10^18. we don't know yet.

Predicate -- proposition whose truth value depends on some variable(s)
p(n) = "n is a perfect square."
under what circumstances is that statement true?

Logical Deduction
Rule
 p, p->q, then q. // implication  (!p || q)

example proof:
Given any x : x <=2 && x >= 0
x, 2-x, 2+x are >= 0
therefore, their product is also >= 0.
Adding 1 to the number gives a + number
x(2-x)(2+x) + 1 > 0.
x(4-x^2) + 1 > 0.
-x^3 + 4x + 1 > 0.

Prove the contrapositive:
  p -> q logically equivalent to ~q -> ~p  (~(p && ~q))

If r is irrational, then sqrt(r) is also irrational
proof:
We prove the contrapositive,
Suppose sqrt(r) is rational.
Then, there exist integers m, n such that sqrt(r) = m/n.
then, r = sqrt(r) * sqrt(r) = (m^2 / n^2).
m^2 and n^2 are also integers, so r is rational.

prove p<->q<-> by showing p = q = r
show p<->q  and q<->r
can also show p->q q->r r->p

proposition p, q
!p
p&&q
p||q
p->q
p<->q
pXORq

* SAT Problem -- Important for testins
  given some formula
  (p||q&&r)
     find values for p, q, r such that the formula is true.
  solution:
  	(p,q,r) = (t,f,f)

SAT problem can yield many, one, or zero solutions.
sets, relations, functions, induction...
set -- bunch of elements or objects.
examples:
D = { 1, 2, 4, 8, ... }

union:
  x \in A U B <=> x \in A or x \in B
intersection:
  x \in A ^ B <=> x \in A and x \in B
difference:
  x \in A - B <=> x \in A and not x \in B
power set:
  set of all subsets

sequence -- list of objects
  (a, b, c)   or  [a, b, c]
  lists have an ordering, and we can have permutations.
  "what is the first element in the list?"
  lists can also have repetition   (a, b, a, c)
  write a list as a set: {(0, a), (1, b), (2, a), (3, c)}
  
Functions -- f: A -> B
  set A = domain. set B = codomain.
  sq : N -> N
  sq(0) = 0, sq(4) = 16
  N = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }

  sqrt: R->R+

Relations -- r: A x B
  r is a relation between A and B.
  r = {(a, 1), (a, 3), (b, 2)}

  reflexive:
  r: A x A
  (for all a \in A, (a, a) \in r)
    ==: N X N  is reflexive.
  
  symmetric:
  for all a, b \in A,
  (a, b) \in r <=> (b, a) \in r

  transitive: 
  ((a, b) \in r and (b, c) in r => (a, c) in r).

  <=: N X N
  { (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), ... }
  reflexive and transitive. not symmetric...

for testing use: 
traversing a graph, keeping track if you're in a cycle or not with Collections style add...


java.lang.Object
bool Object::equals(Object &other);
equals method MUST implement an equivalence relation.
  reflexive, symmetric, and transitive...

--Lecture 3
Induction, then book concepts...
Induction principle: 
Let P be a predicate on nonnegative integers.
if: 
	1) P(0) is true 
	2) P(n) -> P(n+1) for all non negative integers.
then P(m) is true for all nonnegative integers m.

Theorem, for all nonnegative integers n,
	1+2+3+...+n = (n)(n+1)/2

proof:
base case : P(0) is true. (lhs == rhs == 0)
inductive step: 
supose P(n) is true,
then 1+2+3+...+n = (n)(n+1)/2.
then for n+1,
1+2+3+...+n+n+1 = (n)(n+1)/2  +  n+1
= ((n)(n+1) + 2(n+1)(n+1)) /2 = (n+2)(n+1)/2


False theorem.
All horses are the same color
In every set of n>=1 horses, all the horses are the same color.
(n is a nonnegative integer)
once you have a predicate in n, you can attempt induction.
bogus proof of theorem:
base case: n = 1. for any set of 1 horse, there is only 1 color, and the horse is the same color as itself.
indcuction:
left n>= 1, and assume P(n)
consider the a set of n+1 horses:
h1,h2,...,hn,h(n+1)
we need to prove that these n+1 horses are the same color.
by our assumption, first n horses are the same color.
also, by our assumption, the last n horses are the same color.
h2,...,hn.h(n+1).
so, h1 is the same color h2,....,hn, and h(n+1) is the same color as h2,....,hn.
therefore, h1 is the same color as h(n+1).

what if there are just 2 horses?
the two sets are disjoint, no intersection / overlap.
the following logic is invalid on that claim...

Chapter 1:
activities of a test engineer.
traditional based on software activity. beizer's testing levels based on process maturity.
testing basics and coverage criteria for testing.

activities of a test eng:
design tests by creating reqs. transform from reqs into values and scripts that execute. tests.
execute software under test, evaluate results of the test.

acceptance testing: check if the software acceptable to the user
system: check system as a whole.
integration testing: check interactions among different modules. 
module testing: check how each module behaves.
unit: check how small units of code behave individually.

Beizer's testing levels high to low...
testing is a mental discipline that helps software professionals dev higher quality software.
purpose not to prove anything specific, but to reduce the risk of using the software.
show software doesn't / does work.
no diff between testing and debugging

--  validation and verification
validation: process of evalutating software at end of dev to ensure compliance with intended usage
	Are we building the right system?
verification: process of determining whether products of a given phases of dev process fufill the reqs established during previous phase.
	Are we building the system right? Is the implementation correct given the system design?

fault: incorrect line of code
error: (unobserved) incorrect states caused by faults 
failures - (observed) output errors caused by incorrect, error states.

thre conditions must be  satisfied for a failure to be observed.
reachability: must be reachable in the code.
infectability: executing fault must lead to an incorrect state.
propogation: error state must propogate to an incorrect output.

observability: how easy is it to observe behavior in terms of outputs.
effects on environment and hardware/software components.

controllability. how easy to provide the program the needed inputs in terms of values, ops, and behaviors.

test requirements - specific elements of software artifact our test case must cover / satisfy.
some reqs infeasible

coverage criterion: rule or collections of rules that impose test reqs on test suites. 
coverage: given TR for a covereage criterion C, test suit T satisfies C if and only if for each tr in TR, at least one test in T satisfies tr.

Coverage level: given reqs TR and test suite T, coverage level is #reqs satisfied by T / |TR|

--Lecture 4
error: failure state in the program that can't be seen from the outside.
some errors propogate to failures, some do not.

reachability, infection, and propogation.

*understand the basic idea of coverage...
coverage level - # reqs satisfied by T / |TR|
test requirement - specific element of the program that a test case must cover / satisfy.
coverage criterian - rule or collection of rules that impose test reqs on a test suite.
coverage : given test reqs TR for criterion C, test suite T satisfies C if and only if for each tr in TR, at least one test in T satisfies tr.
100% code coverage does NOT imply zero faults

assertTrue(...);


Subsumption
criterion C1 subsumes criterion C2 if and only if every test suite that satisfies C1 also satisfies C2
must be true for EVER test suite...
ex. branch coverage and statement coverage
if a suite covers every branch, then it covers every statement.
black-box: derive from external descriptions, specs, design, requirements
white box: devive from source code internals: branches, conditions, statements.

criteria to define criteria,
cfgs, logical expression, syntactic structure, input domain characterization.

Chapter 2:
define test requirements using graph elems.
create a graph abstraction. ex, control-flow.
evaluate how test execution paths cover test requirements.
No ⊆ N is a set of initial nodes.    Nf ⊆ N is a set of final nodes.



--Lecture 5
HW1 is out on canvas.
graphs are used to abstract the software artifact to test.

**Syntactically reachable if there exists a path from m to n.
let reach(x) be set of nodes reachable from x. (connected component.
can define rreachability from a set of nodes too.
Union of reachablity for the individual nodes.
you can also define reachability on an edge...

**test path - a path p  (poss of length 0) 
starts at an initial node, ends at a final node.
deterministic code, each test executes a unique path.
non deterministic code, each test may execute multiple paths.  (randomization)
p visits n if n is on p. p visits e if e is in p.
path(t) for test path executed by test t.
suite T, path(T) = { path(t) | t ∈ T }


nondeterministic programs - randomization, multiple threads, garbage collection.
hash sets, different implementations of the set interface. not guaranteed a specific execution order in a loop.
If your program makes decisions on some  nondeterministic quality, you will likely have faults in your code.

2 common forms of test criteria - structural graph coverage and data flow coverage.
test req is met by visiting a particular node or edge or touring a particular path.
Graph coverage - given test reqs TR for a graph criterion C, test suite T sat C iff there is some path that meets t.

structural coverage
nod - for each node in reach(N0), TR contains predicate "visit n"
edge - TR contains each reachable path of length up to 1 (inclusive) in G
let tests t1 and t2 be such that: path(t1) = <n0, n1, n2> and path(t2) = <n0, n2>
{t1} gives node coverage, {t1, t2} gives edge coverage.

edge-pair coverage. tr contains each reachable path of up to length 2 of G
prime path - is a simple path that is not a proper subpath of another simple path
prime path coverage - TR contains each prime path in G
	- elegant way to treat loops
complete path coverage - covers all paths in G.

*****Algorithm for finding prime paths : *****
start with paths of length 0, extend to length 1.
prime path - MAXIMAL simple path that CANNOT be EXTENDED without losing its simplicity.
prime paths, no mention of iterating a loop more than once. requires to skip a loop, do a loop once, do a loop more than once.
sometimes, satisfying a requirement EXACTLY is hard. side trips and detours...
tours - test path tours q if q is a subpath of p.
tour with sidetrips - p tours q w. sidetrips if every edge in q is also in p in order.
tour with detours - p tours q with detours if every node in q is also in p in order.


Data flow criteria
focus on data values
def- location where value of a var is stored in memory
use - location where value is accessed.
def(x) and use(x). vars definied and used at an edge or node
du-paths and def-clears paths. 

label the nodes in terms of defs and uses.
all defs, all uses, all du paths.
